Description: flashcard learning program with special support for Japanese
 Anki is a program designed to help you remember facts (such as words and
 phrases in a foreign language) as easily, quickly and efficiently as possible.
 To do this, it tracks how well you remember each fact, and uses that
 information to optimally schedule review times.
 .
 While Anki can be used for studying anything, it also ships with special
 features designed to make studying Japanese and English easier: integrated
 dictionary lookups, missing kanji reports, and more.
 .
 Besides text, it supports sounds, images and rendering TeX snippets in the
 cards.  Sample card decks are included for a subset of the Japanese Language
 Proficiency Test vocabulary and for some Russian vocabulary.
