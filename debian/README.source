The original source archive contains a number of its dependencies for easy
installation, including compiled binaries without source, as well as minified
Javascript without corresponding source code. This necessitates repackaging for
DFSG compliance of the source package. In order to turn an upstream source
archive into a format as used by this packaging, perform the following steps:

* Remove the contents of the "thirdparty" directory except for "send2trash"
* In anki/js.py, remove all lines except the one starting with "browserSel"
* Remove qt_*.qm from locale
