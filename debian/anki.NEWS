anki (0.9.9.8.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Special support for Japanese and Chinese was removed from the anki source
  distribution.  These and many other features are now available in the form
  of plugins that can be downloaded and installed by anki.  The download
  option can be found in the menu under File->Download->Shared Plugin.
