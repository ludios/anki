anki (0.9.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * Remove shell bangs from all Python modules that had them for aesthetic
    reasons, no lintian warnings anymore
  * debian/rules: remove execute permissions from ankiqt/__init__.py for the
    same reason
  * ankiqt/ui/main.py: make setupAutoUpdate() return without doing anything to
    avoid bugging the user about new upstream versions on every start
  * debian/control: move all build depends except debhelper to
    Build-Depends-Indep
