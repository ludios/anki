Thu Feb  1 12:21:46 PST 2007  LaC
  * little card stuff
  - If a card's question is changed by the card generator (because of a
    conflict with an existing card) give an explicit warning in the status
    field. This was in a previous patch, but it was buggy. It's useful for
    when your dictionary has ententries such as "<ban>: evening, night" and
    "<yoru>: evening, night" and you don't realize until you are asked
    "evening, night (1)" and have no idea which one it wants.
  - If you change a card, the filter in the card editor applies to the newly
    entered text (eg if you add a "(vt)" marker and search for "(vt)", it
    shows up).
  - Removed begin/end batch call in mark functions, since the operation is now
    done with a single call.

  UNDO: split main window into 3

Wed Jan 31 22:42:27 PST 2007  fc@ichi2.net
  * split main window into 3

Wed Jan 31 22:24:33 PST 2007  fc@ichi2.net
  * fix conflicts in merge with lac, kill some trailing whitespace

Wed Jan 31 15:50:05 PST 2007  LaC
  * fix stale colors
  Since the existing table rows are no longer deleted (see earlier patch),
  their background color needs to be cleared separately. After considering
  several methods, profiling showed this to be the fastest.

Thu Jan 25 08:06:58 PST 2007  LaC
  * fixed marking rows
  - fixed marking deleted and changed rows in deck editor (broken by faster
    filter patch)

Wed Jan 24 11:47:57 PST 2007  LaC
  * LaC changed mac bundle identifier

Wed Jan 24 10:53:26 PST 2007  LaC
  * LaC setup.py version
  - setup.py now gets the version number from fcwx.py

Wed Jan 24 10:40:19 PST 2007  LaC
  * LaC faster filter
  - changed the implementation of EditDeckDialog.show(); the new version is
    about twice as fast (measured), which is noticeable on my system.

Wed Jan 24 10:37:24 PST 2007  LaC
  * LaC help menu
  - added a bare-bones help menu. Apps always have a help menu on OS X, and it
    looks silly if it's empty. They also require an about command (which gets
    moved to the application menu by wxMac).

Wed Jan 24 09:42:03 PST 2007  LaC
  * LaC bundled kakasi for Mac build

Tue Jan 23 15:19:24 PST 2007  LaC
  * LaC mac binary build
  - added script to produce a binary build for OS X. The build is an universal
    binary (not yet tested on Intel, though) and includes all dependencies
    (Python, wxPython etc.). This simplifies installation and makes it
    possible to include a specially patched version of wxPython that fixes
    some bugs with Japanese text input (the patches have been submitted to wx,
    but have not been committed yet). Note that this patch only includes the
    script; if anyone else wants to make a Mac build, they need to have their
    own copy of wxPython.
  - added icon for Mac binary build.

Tue Jan 23 15:14:09 PST 2007  LaC
  * LaC deck editor
  - renamed the wxglade file with the correct extension
  - fixed a broken call to updateTitleBar
  - interface changes, mainly to the Edit Deck dialog. In particular, instead
    of having a Search button which pops up a modal dialog, the window now has
    a search box where the user can type a query directly and see the results
    in real time (actually with a small delay to ensure that a quick series of
    keystrokes is coalesced into a single search). The search box uses the
    dedicated wx.SearchCtrl, which uses the native search box widget on
    platforms that have one (eg OS X), and falls back on a TextCtrl on those
    that don't.

Tue Jan 23 15:01:44 PST 2007  LaC
  * LaC menus
  - Added keyboard equivalents for several menu commands on Mac.
  - Reorganized menus. The new layout fits much better on OS X, where
    applications are not required to have a File menu: now there is a Deck
    menu containing all commands which operate on the deck as a whole (this
    also avoids having to repeat the word "deck" in every single command,
    which cluttered the menu), while commands such as Quit are in the
    application menu. Other systems don't have an application menu, however,
    so it might be necessary to conditionalize these changes depending on the
    platform.
  - Defined several command IDs in terms of the equivalent standard wx IDs.
    This is supposed to allow such things as displaying the standard command
    icons on GTK.

Tue Jan 23 13:51:59 PST 2007  LaC
  * LaC 0.12 misc
  - support for old/new style display
  - fixed mac menu support
  - better implementation of deck restart
  - edit menu
  - better information dislay in title bar
  - fixed bug with font defaults on mac

Thu Jan 11 20:35:12 PST 2007  fc@ichi2.net

Mon Dec 25 08:19:16 PST 2006  fc@ichi2.net
  * refactor display code, select current card in editor
  - use regexps to match optional furigana (should be less prone to breaking)
  - display furigana on separate line
  - make question and answer centered
  - remove separator line
  - in the editor, select the currently displayed card

Mon Dec 25 06:07:21 PST 2006  fc@ichi2.net
  * honour last card colour, drop multiple colour type support as we pickle

Sun Dec 24 03:07:40 PST 2006  fc@ichi2.net

  - set mac preferences properly
  - display file name in title bar
  - show last card up top
  - display message if incorrect cards are pending
  - only undo RET on windows
  - display approx next time for quality 4/5
  - allow customization of last card colour/font
  - update japanese translations
  - use kakasi in $INSTDIR/kakasi, not c:\kakasi
  - show 'undecided language' last, so that when
    it's hidden it doesn't effect the order on win32/mac
  - accept a deck as a command line argument

Sat Dec 23 05:53:13 PST 2006  fc@ichi2.net
